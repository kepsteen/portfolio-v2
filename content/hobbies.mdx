The only activity I enjoy is coding. When I come home from work, the first thing I do is open my laptop and continue coding. My only other hobbies are reading and writing documentation.

Ok, I&#39;m kidding. I really do love coding and could easily spend all day doing it. However, there are plenty of other things I enjoy. My current obsession is pickleball, which I play at least 2-3 times a week. I also love rewatching my favorite shows, which I&#39;ve seen countless times, including "Lost," "Prison Break," "Breaking Bad," and seasons 1-6 of "Game of Thrones." If I am not at my desk or on the pickleball court, you can probably find me walking my Siberian Husky Luna üê∫.
