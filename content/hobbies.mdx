My current obsession is pickleball, which I play at least 2-3 times a week. I also love rewatching my favorite shows, which I&#39;ve seen countless times, including "Lost," "Prison Break," "Breaking Bad," and seasons 1-6 of "Game of Thrones." If I am not at my desk or on the pickleball court, you can probably find me walking my Siberian Husky Luna üê∫.
