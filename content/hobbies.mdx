The only activity I enjoy is coding. When I come home from work, the first thing I do is open my laptop and continue coding. My only other hobbies are
reading and writing documentation.

Ok, I&#39;m kidding. I really do love coding and could easily spend all day doing it.
However, there are plenty of other things I enjoy. My current obsession is pickleball, which I try to play at least 2-3 times per week. I also love rewatching my favorite shows,
that I've seen countless times, including "Lost," "Prison Break," "Breaking Bad," and seasons 1-6 of "Game of Thrones." If I&#39;m not
at my desk or on the picklebal court, then you can probably find me out walking my Siberian Husky Luna üê∫.
