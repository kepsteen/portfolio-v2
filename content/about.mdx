My name is Cody, and I'm a Full Stack Software Developer specializing in React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node, and PostgreSQL. My journey began in healthcare as a Certified Nursing Assistant working in inpatient care during the pandemic while pursuing a career as a Physician Assistant.

My path to coding started unexpectedly when a friend gifted me Python Programming by John Zelle. I could only tolerate learning from something as archaic as a textbook for so long before I decided to buy a Udemy course, specifically 100 Days of Python. After shelling out the $20 for the course, I was determined to follow it exactly and code every day for the next 100 days. Of course, it didn't work out like that, and it took me a little over a year to finish most of the course. However, my love for coding and building projects grew over time, and I finally decided to take the leap and switch from healthcare to software development.

This led me to enroll at LearningFuze, a full-stack web development boot camp, where I immersed myself in an agile-like environment. I mastered React, TypeScript, Node with Express, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS there. The intensive curriculum and practical approach accelerated my development journey.
